# 🕷️ Django Web Crawler Agent (Local Scraper + AWS Bedrock)

This project is a lightweight web crawler agent built with **Django**. It accepts prompts like:

> Crawl this URL: https://example.com

It then:
1. Locally scrapes and cleans the page HTML using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
2. Sends the cleaned content as context to **Anthropic Claude via AWS Bedrock**
3. Returns a response generated by Claude
